## Hi, I'm Lindsey! 

- I am a junior studying data science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
- I am interested in large scale data analysis, and using data to make informed insights. I have a particular interest in political analysis, social media analysis, and general analysis for the public good. 
- I know Python, SQL, R, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn. 
- I am currently working with BACKCOURT Business to conduct a sentiment analysis on tweets surrounding two target sports experiences. This analysis will be used to fuel business insights for BACKCOURT and sports tourism.
